# Highlights ! {#headings}
I created a new level four in the game. Here are key commits:
- Kirby sprites, new background, magikarp enemies
- new tube js file to change positioning, same purpose
- reused old bricks and coins because they matched with the theme.

## new additions!
I wanted a solid obstacle, one that wasn't moving, so I decided to implement a "green goo" pond that kirby has to look out for.

I let the magikarp run free in the water because fish are good at swimming, and they should be able to swim through the goo. I wanted to change the speed so that magikarp is faster in the goo, but it looks like it's still bugging out a little.

I reused the tube class and added the same death collision in the player so that the green goo is toxic to Kirby.

### my old game(s)
Back to tri one, we made a snake game / customized with CSS. It's simple and uses emojis as the snake/food. 
Added new emojis, start over / speed changer.

I linked the very first mario game (mario 0).
I promise I'm not missing files thats just the way the game looks.
Goomba sprite is not aligned properly, but it is semi-multiplayer because the goomba moves with the jkl keys, and the mario moves with WASD.
Mario will destroy goomba upon contact. Simple backgrounds and mario and goomba are fighting to the death.
