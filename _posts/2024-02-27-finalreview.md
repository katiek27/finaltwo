# Highlights ! {#headings}
I created a new level four in the game. Here are key commits:
- Kirby sprites, new background, magikarp enemies
- new tube js file to change positioning, same purpose
- reused old bricks and coins because they matched with the theme.

### my old game(s)
Back to tri one, we made a snake game / customized with CSS. It's simple and uses emojis as the snake/food. 
Added new emojis, start over / speed changer.

I linked the very first mario game (mario 0)
I promise I'm not missing files thats just the way the game looks.
Goomba sprite is not aligned properly, but it is almost multiplayer because the goomba moves with the jkl keys, and the mario moves with WASD.
Mario will destroy goomba upon contact. Simple backgrounds because simple is best.
