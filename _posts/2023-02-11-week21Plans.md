# an overview {#headings}
We will be borrowing from the existing SettingsControl.js and trying to form a leaderboard in the same sense that the settings tab is displayed in.

To accomplish this...
- getters for leaderboard
- leaderboard class OOP
- figuring out time variable / score variable to display
- SASS the leaderboard, make it look good

We can use the md file to display
