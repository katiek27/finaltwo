# showtime ! {#headings}
I was really glad to see people making good use of our leaderboard. They would try to beat the game as fast as possible and then look up their names on the leaderboard, I heard a lot of "there I am!"s or "Look! I'm __ place!" and our leaderboard had a lot of storage by the end of N@TM. 

### success!
I'm also really glad we got the multiplayer leaderboard in because it gave the people a sense of purpose for the game: to move up on the leaderboard.

I feel I was able to summarize our entire group's work while presenting to others, which didn't bore them and overall, people were really impressed that we had created the entire game!

### improvement
We could've explained more about the coding process, but people were more interested in playing our game (fair enough).

I wish we would've emphasized the naming use as well as a functioning chat to our players more, it adds a level of personality and individualism to the game.

### other cs projects
I was impressed by the projets the CSP students created, some experimented with AI to predict trends. Their blogs were also well-crafted and insightful.

After, I got to see some of Gabriel's 3D animation video, which was cool as well! I liked the different style of coding / animation and the other animations were fun to watch!
