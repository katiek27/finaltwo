# What have we done? #
- added trimester one blog in Week 0 plans. 
- Edited teacher blog, specifically the Mario game
- Added styling using SASS in the personal repo

## Mario blog ##
- I added a Goomba feature into the game, it moves using J, I, and L.
- The sprite image won't work D:
- Class Goomba extends the Character class, in which it uses the same collisions and movement styles.
- Mostly copied from the Character class as well as the Player class. 

- implemented using OOP.

> worked on some collisions, whenever the two meet, the goomba will start the this.destroy function, which erases it off the board. Could be elaborated on so goomba "kills" mario.
- got familiar with the inheriting of classes, especially from parent and grandparent classes.

## and then there was css #
> got familiar with sass, and how it works.
- to my understanding, it's using these $ values for colors, and then using those as the styling choices for the CSS. 
- this is typically easier because I don't have to manually add in my colors everytime
- Mostly changed the "darkmode" sass file and the colors. 
- Also made my own SASS $ values and used those to customize the search bar results, table columns, etc.
