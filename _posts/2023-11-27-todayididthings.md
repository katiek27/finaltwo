# What have we done? #
- added trimester one blog in Week 0 plans. 
- Edited teacher blog, specifically the Mario game
- Added styling using SASS in the personal repo

## Mario blog ##
- I added a Goomba feature into the game, it moves using J, I, and L.
- The sprite image won't work D:
- Class Goomba extends the Character class, in which it uses the same collisions and movement styles.
- Mostly copied from the Character class as well as the Player class. 

- implemented using OOP.
